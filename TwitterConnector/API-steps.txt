Steps to make an authenticated GET-HTTP request to Twitter:
1. Get data (tweet, account, keys) and (unix-)time
2. Create a random string of 32 characters, the "nonce", this one is encoded to Base64
3. Create the parameters (include_entities, oauth_consumer_key, oauth_nonce, oauth_signature_method, oauth_token, oauth_version, status)
	Those have to be "Percent-encoded"
4. Create base signature using the percent-encoded parameters
5. State the URL and add the parameters, this is the signature base
6. Use the percent-encoded consumerSecret and the percent-encoded accessSecret to generate a key
7. Create the signature using the base and the key
8. Use the paramaters to generate the OAuth-data
9. Make an OAuth string of this data, which is percent-encoded
10. Make the request.

Class Encoder (Both UTF-8!):
- Base64-string
- Percent
- Timestamp
- Nonce-gen

Class for creating the right URL?
- Depends on method and data type: needed: kind of data to be fetched or send.
